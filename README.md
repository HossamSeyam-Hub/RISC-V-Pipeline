# RISC-V-Pipeline

This repository contains an implementation of a pipelined RISC-V processor, designed to execute a subset of the RV32I instruction set efficiently. The processor follows a five-stage pipeline architecture to improve instruction throughput while handling data and control hazards.

ðŸ›‘Features

  âœ³Implements a 5-stage pipeline:
  
  âœ…Fetch (IF) â€“ Instruction fetching from memory

  âœ…Decode (ID) â€“ Instruction decoding and register read

  âœ…Execute (EX) â€“ ALU operations and branch calculations
