# RISC-V-Pipeline

This repository contains an implementation of a pipelined RISC-V processor, designed to execute a subset of the RV32I instruction set efficiently. The processor follows a five-stage pipeline architecture to improve instruction throughput while handling data and control hazards.

Features

  âœ³Implements a 5-stage pipeline:
  
    âœ…Fetch (IF) â€“ Instruction fetching from memory

    âœ…Decode (ID) â€“ Instruction decoding and register read

    âœ…Execute (EX) â€“ ALU operations and branch calculations

    âœ…Memory (MEM) â€“ Data memory access

    âœ…Write-back (WB) â€“ Writing results back to registers

  âœ³Supports a subset of the RV32I instruction set

  âœ³Implements hazard detection and forwarding to resolve data dependencies

  âœ³Designed in Verilog

  âœ³Testbenches and example programs included
